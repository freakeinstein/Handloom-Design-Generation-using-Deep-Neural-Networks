1. tv 1e-7 content 1e-3 texture 1e-6 epoch 0-13

2. tv 1e-6 texture same content 1e-1 epoch 13 - ?? : Did not worked at all complete mess

3. content loss seems to have almost not effect, I am telling you man

4. tv  1e-7 content 1e-3 texture 1e-5 epoch 0-16: Not acceptable results not at all

5. tv 1e-9 content 1e-4 texture 1e-5 , to be noted when content is 10^2 times lesser then the image formed is having the color and aethetics but not the style and strokes. It like a color transfer minus the border stylings. Even if there is some small brush style strokes with dark edge forming pattern it is not being prominent immediately

6. Behaviour:
                  tv : 0 texture 0
	content 1e-3:  Simple image reconstruction with blurrness and no 		         content space lines and patterns
	content 1e-2:  Image reconstruction with scales and possible line 		         patterns from target content (Preserves most content)
	content 1e-1: Image reconstruction with larger and prominent                                             wavy scales
                 content 1 : doesnt looks good at all horrible

	content 1e-2 texture 0
	tv 1e-6: Appears to blurr out the scales and patterns
	tv 1e-8: no more effect on the content and no blurring	
	
	content 1e-2 tv 1e-8
	texture 1: This appears a complete content preservation config
		 The Image base remains , edges are muddled with new 		style , color is changing so its the texture , structural type 			also affected in smaller scale
